MOUSE PARTY
======

OH YEAH!

Express/SocketIO/D3 experiment. Used D3 for mouse animations as an excuse to play with it. Drawing is not optimized.

Creates a single-page "room" that displays all users' mouses as a pointer on the screen. No example online because 
I had some trouble finding free NodeJS PaaS that fully support true websockets.
